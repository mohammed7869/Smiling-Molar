    <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Counts as a Dental Emergency?</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
      <li><strong>Severe tooth pain</strong> that won't subside with OTC meds - could indicate infection or nerve involvement.</li>
      <li><strong>Knocked-out tooth (avulsion)</strong> - one of the few true dental "save or lose" situations depending on timing.</li>
      <li><strong>Cracked, fractured, or severely chipped teeth</strong> - sharp edges, exposed nerve, or structural weakness.</li>
      <li><strong>Deep cuts to the tongue, lips, or gums</strong> that continuously bleed.</li>
      <li><strong>Abscess or swelling near a tooth</strong> - signs of infection that can spread if untreated.</li>
      <li><strong>A missing or loose crown or filling</strong> can leave the tooth exposed, leading to sharp pain and sensitivity.</li>
      <li><strong>Severe swelling of the face or jaw</strong>, which can impact breathing in extreme cases - call immediately.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">If your symptoms come on suddenly, worsen, or feel severe, treat it as urgent and contact your dentist immediately.</p>

    <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 ">What You Should Do Right Away in a Dental Emergency</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">When you're dealing with pain or trauma, clear steps help. Here's what to do right away:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
      <li><strong>Stay calm</strong> - panic spikes pain and makes it harder to act.</li>
      <li><strong>Call Tulip Dental immediately</strong> and describe the situation - we'll give specific instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>To stop bleeding:</strong> place clean gauze on the area and press firmly for about 10–15 minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduce swelling:</strong> cold compress applied outside the face for 10–15 minutes at a time.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage pain:</strong> take OTC pain relievers per label directions (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) unless contraindicated. Avoid placing aspirin directly on gums.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect loose teeth:</strong> don't wiggle them; avoid chewing on that side.</li>
      <li><strong>For knocked-out teeth:</strong> hold the tooth by the crown, rinse briefly, and store in milk or the patient's saliva - get to the dentist fast.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Same-Day Emergency Care Matters</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">You might think waiting a few days won't hurt, but dental problems are deceptive. Here's why same-day care is critical:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
      <li>Saves natural teeth - early root canal or reimplantation increases success rates.</li>
      <li>Prevents spread of infection - what starts as a tooth abscess can become a systemic problem if untreated.</li>
      <li>Reduces long-term treatment costs - fixing a problem early is often cheaper and less invasive than complex reconstruction later.</li>
      <li>Quick pain relief not only makes you more comfortable but also helps you sleep, eat, and recover without added complications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">In short: treating dental problems quickly is like fixing a leaking roof before the beams rot - it preserves structure, function, and the value of your investment (your teeth).</p>

      <li><strong>Brush twice and floss daily</strong> - consistent care prevents decay that turns into pain.</li>

              <div class="faq">
                  <strong class="text-lg">1. What should I do if my tooth gets knocked out?</strong><br>
                  Pick up the tooth by the crown (not the root), rinse gently with water, place it in milk or saliva, and come to the dentist immediately - ideally within 30–60 minutes for the best chance of reimplantation.

              <div class="faq">
                  <strong class="text-lg">2. Is a severe toothache always an emergency?</strong><br>
                  Severe or persistent tooth pain should be treated as urgent. It may signal infection or nerve damage that can worsen quickly without treatment.
              </div>
  
              <div class="faq">
                  <strong class="text-lg">3. Can you fix a broken tooth the same day?</strong><br>
                  Often yes. Depending on the damage, we can smooth, bond, or place a same-day crown to restore function and appearance.
              </div>
  
              <div class="faq">
                  <strong class="text-lg">4. Will emergency treatment be covered by insurance?</strong><br>
                  Most insurance plans cover emergency dental care, but coverage varies. Tulip Dental staff will help verify benefits and explain expected costs before treatment when possible.
              </div>
  
              <div class="faq">
                  <strong class="text-lg">5. What if my child breaks a baby tooth?</strong><br>
                  If a baby tooth is broken, call us for guidance. Reimplantation of baby teeth is usually not recommended, but prompt evaluation ensures proper treatment and protects the developing adult tooth.

    <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Pediatric Dentistry Is So Important</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">Children's teeth may be small, but they play a big role in their overall health and development. Healthy baby teeth are essential for proper chewing, speech development, and guiding permanent teeth into the right positions. Neglecting dental care at an early age can lead to cavities, gum infections, and even orthodontic problems later on.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">At Tulip Dental in Maplewood, we believe that pediatric dentistry is not just about fixing teeth, but about <strong>building a strong foundation for lifelong oral health</strong>. When kids learn the importance of dental hygiene early, they carry those habits into adulthood.</p>

  <section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">When Should Children First Visit the Dentist?</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">Many parents find themselves asking what the right age is for their child's very first dental visit. According to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the first visit should be by the child's <strong>first birthday</strong> or within <strong>six months after the first tooth appears</strong>.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">This early introduction has two major benefits:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
      <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Early prevention allows dentists to detect small concerns before they turn into bigger dental problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Children become familiar with the dental environment, making future visits less stressful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">Starting dental visits early also gives parents valuable tips on how to care for their child's teeth at home, from proper brushing techniques to diet recommendations.</p>

  <section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Services Offered in Pediatric Dentistry</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">At Tulip Dental, we provide a complete range of pediatric services designed to protect your child's teeth and keep their smile healthy as they grow. Some of the most important services include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
      <li><strong>Regular Checkups and Cleanings:</strong> Routine visits help remove plaque and tartar, while also monitoring the development of baby and permanent teeth.</li>
      <li><strong>Fluoride Treatments and Sealants:</strong> These preventive measures strengthen enamel and protect the deep grooves of molars from decay.</li>
      <li><strong>Fillings and Restorations:</strong> If cavities develop, we use gentle techniques and child-friendly materials to restore teeth without causing fear or discomfort.</li>

    <p class="mb-2">Fear of the dentist is common among children, but it can be prevented with the right approach. At Tulip Dental, we use techniques such as "tell-show-do," where we explain the procedure, demonstrate it with simple examples, and then gently carry it out.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">We also:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
      <li>We welcome parents to remain with their children during appointments to provide comfort and reassurance.</li>
      <li>Use positive reinforcement and rewards to build trust.</li>
      <li>Create a bright, welcoming space that feels fun rather than intimidating.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">By making early visits positive, children are far less likely to develop dental anxiety as they grow older.</p>

    <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Building Healthy Dental Habits That Last</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">A huge part of pediatric dentistry is teaching children and families how to take care of their teeth at home. Our dentists and hygienists spend time showing kids the right way to brush and floss, using fun demonstrations that keep them engaged.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">Parents also receive advice on:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
      <li>The impact of sugary snacks and drinks.</li>
      <li>The role of nutrition in preventing cavities.</li>
      <li>Guidance on managing habits such as thumb sucking and teeth grinding.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">These lessons help children understand that caring for their teeth is part of everyday life, not just something that happens at the dentist's office.</p>
